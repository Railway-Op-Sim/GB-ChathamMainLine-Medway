## Chatham Main Line Rochester to Faversham + Medway Valley & Sheerness Lines

The Chatham Main Line is a busy railway stretching from Central London and the West End in the North through the London commuter towns of Medway, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Whitstable, Herne Bay, Ramsgate, Canterbury and many more. It is a vital link to the south coast, providing faster and more direct services than the South Eastern Main Line and serving more communities than HS1 could ever dream of. Despite the importance, much of the line, even within London, is only double tracked, leaving only short sections of track for trains to overtake. Can you accurately signal and route trains to make sure everyone gets to there destinations on time? Id you can, you can safely claim you are better than both Southeastern and Thameslink combined.
